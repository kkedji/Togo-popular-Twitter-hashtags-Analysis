Twitter Data Analysis for Digital Marketing
This project aims to use Twitter data analysis to help a digital marketing agency conquer the digital market of an emerging country. The project involves scraping tweets from Twitter using snscrape, cleaning the data in Jupyter Notebook, saving the file in CSV, loading it in a database in Microsoft SQL Server, performing exploratory analysis with some SQL queries and finally visualizing some key insights in Power BI.

Getting Started
To run this project, you will need the following tools and packages:

Python 3.8 or higher
Snscrape 0.3.5 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Microsoft SQL Server
Power BI Desktop
You will also need to create a Twitter developer account and obtain your API keys and tokens.


To run this project, you need to follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook file twitter_data_analysis.ipynb and run the cells to scrape, clean, and preprocess the Twitter data. 
The output of this notebook is a CSV file named tweets.csv that contains the cleaned and processed data.
Open the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and create a new database named Tweets. Then, import the CSV file into a table named TgTweets using the Import Wizard.
Open the SQL file twitter_data_queries.sql and run the queries to perform an exploratory analysis of the data. You can also modify or add your own queries as per your needs.
Open the Power BI Desktop file Twitter_Data_Analysis_.pbix and explore the dashboards and reports that visualize the findings and recommendations of the data analysis. You can also create your own visuals or modify the existing ones as per your preferences.
